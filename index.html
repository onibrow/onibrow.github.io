<h2>
<a id="bio" class="anchor" href="#bio" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h2>

<p>Age: 21</p>

<p>3rd Year EECS @ UC Berkeley</p>

<p>I live to create. Be it software or hardware, when I get inspired to make something, I try my very best to accomplish it. My passion for engineering motivates me to pursue a wide range of projects, from smaller tasks like hosting and maintaining my own git server to more ambitious undertakings, such as building an RFID activated door and an arcade fight stick from scratch. Moreover, I enjoy brainstorming new project ideas to tackle so I can constantly be working to advance my skill set. While not all of my endeavors end up successful in the way I originally plan, I strive to learn from every experience.</p>

<p>While I spend much of my time surrounded by my work bench of electrical tools and my sizable medley of computers, I also devote myself to making music, practicing karate, enjoying the outdoors, and teaching. Above all, teaching has been a very rewarding experience for me. I get to interact with a wide age range of people teaching all sorts of subjects, from teaching third graders reading comprehension to teaching fourth year college students circuit analysis. The most rewarding part of teaching would be seeing passionate students conquer difficult subjects and light up. Aside from that, my interest include hiking, boarding, biking, discovering new music, and fashion.</p>
