<h2>
<a id="bio" class="anchor" href="#bio" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h2>

<p>Age: 20</p>

<p>2nd Year EECS @ UC Berkeley</p>

<p>I live to create. Be it software or hardware, when I get inspired to make something, I try my very best to accomplish it. My passion for engineering motivates me to pursue a wide range of projects, from smaller tasks like hosting and maintaining my own git server to more ambitious undertakings, such as building a rfid activated doors and arcade fight sticks from scratch. Moreover, I enjoy brainstorming new project ideas to tackle so I can constantly be working to advance my skillset. While not all of my endeavors end up successful in the way I originally plan, I strive to learn from every experience.</p>

<p>While I spend much of my time surrounded by my work bench of electrical tools and my sizable medley of computers, I also devote myself to making music, practicing karate, enjoying the outdoors, and teaching. I have been in involved in orchestra playing viola, in chorus, a cappella groups, and jazz choir as a bass voice, and in marching band as captain of drumline. In addition, I have a black belt in karate, as well as 13 years of experience, and I continue to train as a member of the UC Berkeley Karate Club. Teaching has been a very rewarding experience for me. I get to interact with a wide age range of kids, and seeing them light up makes my day. With the rest of my free time, I like to hike, board, bike, swim, rollerblade, and unicycle.</p>
