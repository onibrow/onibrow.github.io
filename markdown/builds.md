# Computer Builds

## Peachy-PC

[Parts](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/onibrow/saved/#view=Phrbt6)

![peachy](img/peachy.JPG)

Peachy-PC is my first self build tower. I picked out the parts and assembled it myself. My now rare GTX 260 came from an older pre-built tower I had. Future upgrades include: RX 480, DDR4 RAM, and a bigger SSD. It runs Windows 7, and mainly serves as my multimedia computer. Despite its colors, it has the name "Peachy" because I received a plushie peach as a gift near the build time.

## Melon

Melon is an Acer Chromebook, one of the first of its kind. I got this as a christmas present back in 2013 when the Chromebooks first came out. It has gone through many iterations, including [crouton](https://www.linux.com/learn/how-easily-install-ubuntu-chromebook-crouton), to Arch GNU/Linux (by enabling [legacy boot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Chrome_OS_devices)) running GNOME, to LXDE, and then back to crouton. Despite its cheap price and low specs, it runs Arch very well, especially on the ultra-lightweight Light X11 DE. Melon gets its name from its mangled outside to unpredicatble innards with its constantly changing OS.

## Tomato

Tomato is an [IBM Thinkpad T60](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/migr-62722). It ran Arch GNU/Linux with LXDE. I used this laptop as my primary school work laptop, and Arch meddling laptop. It ran extremely slow on bootup and did not jive well with IntelliJ or Chrome, it worked. I learned most of what I now know about the GNU/Linux operating system thanks to Tomato. The name is a reference to Cowboy Bebop.

## Kiwi

Kiwi is a Kickstarter Project called [PINE64](https://www.pine64.com/). Despite its backlash it has recently received due to some shipping issues, I found mine to be in good shape and properly delivered. I have it running the special Debian distro specially made for the board, and use it as a portable multimedia device, an SSH server, and as a play tool. It gets its name from the dark green color of the board.

## Korean-Apple Pear Proclaimed by Andy (K.A.P.P.A)

![kappa-inside](img/kappa2.JPG)

Kappa is a Frankenstein computer. All of its parts, minus the 4-pin to SATA power, comes from my club, Pioneers in Engineering. I scavenged a few mysterious parts, threw theminto a box, and secured them all down by hot glueing lego pieces to keep the parts in place. Then I cut out holes on the sides for power, mobo-out, and a fan from Peachy-PC's left over CPU cooler that I didn't use for that build. By docking the CPU fan on the side, air flow was possible. I installed Windows 7 as well as Elementary OS on it. It runs smoothly, and it will sit in my club room for everyone's use. The name originates from the at-the-time club director, Andy's, favorite fruit, the Korean-Apple Pear.

## JamCherri

JamCherri is a [Thinkpad T420](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/t420s/). It is by far my favorite laptop I have owned. Reasonably priced, but still packs a punch. It came with windows 8, soon upgraded to 10, and Arch GNU/Linux. The desktop envoronment of choice is XFCE4, and is my current work laptop. It has 4 hours of battery life, and runs lightening quick. JamCherri gets its strange name from my high school drumline director's nickname.
