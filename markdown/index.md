##Bio

Name: Seiya Ono

Age: 19

2nd Year EECS @ UC Berkeley

My ideal workspace is to be surrounded by many computers from towers to laptops to on-board CPUs, with many, many monitors, as well as a work bench full of all sorts of electrical tools. That is exactly what my room looks like right now. A couple keyboards, many laptops, open air computers, motors, an MTA crimper, and even a cutting board with a soldering iron on it. I live to create. Whether software or hardware, if I get inspired to make something, I will try my very best to accomplish it. And along the way, I'll think of more projects to do and add them to my list. Only some make it to the very end. But I am very proud of the few that do. From small projects like hosting and maintaining my own git server, to building a home RFID activated door robot, I pursure what I love. 

Outside of my cluttered, solder smelling room, I spend a lot of time outdoors. I have been in orchestra playing viola, sang bass in choir, a capella, and jazz choir, and was part of a drumline. Karate has also been a huge part of my life, having 13 years of experience, earning my black belt at the Orange County Karate Dojo, continuing my training at Cal Karate. I enjoy hiking, boarding, biking, swimming, roller blading, unicycling, and overall challenging myself to whatever I can get my hands on.
